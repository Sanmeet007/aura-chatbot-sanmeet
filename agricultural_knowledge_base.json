    "question": "Why is my lettuce growing slowly?",
    "answer": "Lettuce growth can slow due to several factors: 1) Temperature outside optimal range (18-22°C) - lettuce metabolism significantly reduces below 15°C or above 25°C. 2) Insufficient light (PPFD below 200 µmol/m²/s) limits photosynthesis. 3) Low EC (below 1.2 mS/cm) means insufficient nutrients for growth. 4) pH imbalance (outside 5.5-6.5 range) affects nutrient uptake. 5) Root zone issues like low oxygen or disease. 6) Plant spacing too dense causing competition.",

    "question": "What causes lettuce leaves to turn yellow?",
    "answer": "Yellowing in lettuce (chlorosis) typically indicates: 1) Nitrogen deficiency - most common cause, usually from EC below 1.0 mS/cm. Lower leaves yellow first. 2) Iron deficiency - younger leaves yellow while veins stay green, often caused by high pH above 6.5. 3) Magnesium deficiency - yellowing between veins on older leaves. 4) Overwatering or root rot reducing nutrient uptake. 5) Light stress - too much light can cause bleaching. 6) Natural aging of lower leaves in mature plants.",

    "question": "What is tip burn in lettuce and how do I prevent it?",
    "answer": "Tip burn is when leaf edges turn brown and crispy, caused by calcium deficiency in new growth. This happens even with adequate calcium in solution due to: 1) High humidity (>80%) reducing transpiration. 2) Inconsistent watering causing calcium transport issues. 3) Rapid growth phases. 4) High EC (>2.0 mS/cm). 5) Low airflow. Prevention: maintain humidity 60-70%, ensure consistent irrigation, use fans for air circulation, keep EC in optimal range, ensure adequate calcium in nutrient solution.",

    "answer": "Electricity breakdown for 10m² farm: Lights: 2000W × 16h/day × 30 days = 960 kWh/month (₹4,800 at ₹5/kWh). Cooling/Heating: 1000W × 8h/day × 30 days = 240 kWh/month (₹1,200). Fans/Pumps: 200W × 24h/day × 30 days = 144 kWh/month (₹720). Dehumidifier: 300W × 12h/day × 30 days = 108 kWh/month (₹540). Total: ~1452 kWh/month = ₹7,260 for 10m². Per m²: ₹726/month electricity. Cost varies with: LED efficiency (newer LEDs use 30-40% less), Climate (AC needs higher in summer), Insulation quality. Electricity is 25-35% of operating costs.",

    "question": "What photoperiod should I use for lettuce?",
    "answer": "Lettuce photoperiod options: 16 hours on / 8 hours off: Most common, good balance of growth and electricity cost. 18 hours on / 6 hours off: Slightly faster growth, higher electricity. 14 hours on / 10 hours off: More energy efficient, slightly slower growth. 24 hours continuous: NOT recommended - plants need dark period for optimal growth, higher electricity cost, no significant benefit. DLI (Daily Light Integral) matters more than duration: 16h × 250 PPFD = 14.4 DLI (good), 18h × 220 PPFD = 14.3 DLI (same result). Optimize: Calculate your DLI, adjust PPFD and hours for target, consider time-of-day electricity rates.",

    "answer": "System comparison for beginners: 1) NFT (Nutrient Film Technique): Pros: Water efficient, good oxygenation, easy harvest. Cons: Pump failure = quick death, requires slope, not for heavy plants. Best for: Lettuce, herbs. 2) DWC (Deep Water Culture): Pros: Simple, forgiving, low maintenance. Cons: Temperature control critical, oxygenation needed. Best for: Lettuce, beginners. 3) Kratky (Passive DWC): Pros: No electricity, ultra-simple. Cons: Single harvest, not recirculating. Best for: Learning, microgreens. 4) Ebb & Flow: Pros: Versatile, supports many crops. Cons: Complex, more points of failure. Recommendation for beginners: Start with DWC or simple NFT.",

    "answer": "Spacing by crop type: Lettuce (head): 20cm × 20cm (25 plants/m²), Lettuce (baby leaf): 10cm × 10cm (100 plants/m²), Microgreens: Dense seeding (no individual spacing), Pak Choi: 15cm × 15cm (44 plants/m²), Herbs (basil): 15cm × 15cm (44 plants/m²), Arugula: 8cm × 8cm (156 plants/m²). Vertical tier spacing: 40-50cm between shelves for lettuce/greens, 60-80cm for taller herbs, 30cm for microgreens. Too close: Poor air circulation, disease risk, uneven light, competition. Too far: Wasted space, lower yield per m². Optimize by testing and tracking yield per m².",

    "question": "Does vertical farming work year-round in India?",
    "answer": "Vertical farming advantages in India: Year-round production: Controlled environment eliminates seasonal limitations. Summer challenges (Apr-Jun): High ambient temps increase cooling costs (30-50% more), harder to maintain 18-22°C, higher humidity control needs. Solutions: Better insulation, shade cloth on building, night-time growing. Monsoon benefits (Jul-Sep): Lower cooling needs, but higher humidity to control, power outages risk. Winter benefits (Nov-Feb): Lower/no cooling costs, easier temperature control, may need heating in North India. Best margins: October-March (lower electricity). Worst margins: May-August (high cooling costs). Indoor farming excels in extreme climates where outdoor is impossible.",

Water savings: 90-95% vs field farming. For 10m² farm producing 50kg lettuce/month: Water usage: 500-1000 liters/month total, Actual consumption: 200-400 liters (rest recirculates), Cost: ₹40-₹80/month (municipal water). Water management: Daily top-up: 5-10% of system volume, Complete change: Every 2-4 weeks, Filter and treat for reuse, Monitor EC rise (indicates water evaporation). Biggest sustainability advantage of vertical farming.",

How they enter: On people/clothing, Through ventilation, On new plants/seeds, Already in growing medium. Prevention (IPM): 1) Sanitation - clean between crops, remove debris. 2) Positive pressure - filtered air intake. 3) Sticky traps - monitor and catch. 4) Quarantine - inspect new materials. 5) Physical barriers - screens on vents. Treatment if needed: Biological controls (ladybugs, parasitic wasps), Organic sprays (neem oil, insecticidal soap), As last resort: targeted pesticides (check organic certification if applicable). Most indoor farms have minimal pest pressure vs outdoor.",
